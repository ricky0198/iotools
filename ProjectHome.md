The iotools package provides a set of simple command line tools which allow access to hardware device registers.  Supported register interfaces include PCI, IO, memory mapped IO, SMBus, CPUID, and MSR.  Also included are some utilities which allow for simple arithmetic, logical, and other operations.

If you ever have to debug hardware, you could probably use these tools.
